# Abstracts for Github Universe 2016

# Chrome Exts + Github == Love
We love Github. We use it in a myriad of ways every day. In fact, we love it so much we built a Chrome Ext to tie it closer to our very own platform. Have you ever wanted to integrate Github with your to do list or maybe your internal status reporting.  You could accomplish this all with a chrome extension. In this talk I’ll deep dive into how we built a Chrome Ext to tie our services to Github Issues and how you can do the same. We’ll cover oAuth, the Github API and some of the Chrome APIs. I’ll also discuss how you can contribute to our own open source Ext.

These talks will be presented by Chris DeLaurentis, an architect who has been improving Topcoder's development process for their over 1,000,000 member community while delivering working on some of the largest users of Github.com and Github Enterprise.

# Using Github & Other People to GSD (Especially the stuff you don't like to do)
What developer enjoys writing testing, test cases and documentation? Surprisingly there are a lot and they exist everywhere, maybe inside your own corporate rules if not definitely outside your walls.  Using Github and Github issues, I will walk you through leveraging issues to manage work streams across multiple resources and people.  A quick hands on demo will including best practices for setting up your repo for additional collaborators and walk you through the how to accept solutions from collaborators. In addition to all that I’ll give a brief overview of how we built a Chrome Ext to facilitate all this on our Topcoder platform and other approaches to working with external vendors like bug bounty programs.
